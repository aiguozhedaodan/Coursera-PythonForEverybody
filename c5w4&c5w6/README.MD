### 4.Optional Challenge:
Change the gline.py program to show the message count by year instead of by month and take a screen shot of the by year visualization. You can switch from a by-month to a by-year visualization by changing only a few lines in gline.py. The puzzle is to figure out the smallest change to accomplish the change. If you do not want to do this optional challenge - just upload the above image a second time.
