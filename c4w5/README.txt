Although Google Maps' api is charged, it will give a balance of $300 after registration, and the balance is valid for one year. I added additional 985 program universities in China (ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_985) based on the teacher database. I have removed the api on the screenshot from my Google account, and everyone should be careful not to divulge it. Thanks to the teacher, thank the classmates, let us continue to enjoy the fun of python.
